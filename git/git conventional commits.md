# Conventional commits

Conventional commits is a Git commit convention made by the Angular team. Basically, every pull request should end up with one commit and a standardized commit message.

The message should follow this regex:

```
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/
```
